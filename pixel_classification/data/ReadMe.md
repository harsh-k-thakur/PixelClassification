In Pixel Classification there should be particular data that needs to be kept. 

The Bin Detection data can be downloaded from my [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Pm1ZdWcrpNNu8P1i8R0j12nrpgIl8Y_y?usp=sharing). 

The training data is used to train at the same time validation data is used so that we don't overfit the model.
Here the model is simple i.e. Maximum Likelihood and it just the whole dataset in one iteration.
Thus the complexity is less but the model is still pretty good.
