# GradeScope Autograder
The code that the GradeScope Autograder uses to test your code is provided here for reference.
It is not required to run this code but it may help you debug the code you upload to GradeScope.
If you would like to run the Autograder on your local machine, which is optional, you may follow the steps below:

1. Install the GradeScope autograder and other required packages from `requirements.txt`

2. Run the tests:

```
python3 run_tests.py
```

The training data for Color Classification can be downloaded from my [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Pm1ZdWcrpNNu8P1i8R0j12nrpgIl8Y_y?usp=sharing).
While the training images for the Recycling Bin Detection can be found at this [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1faFKS5_sdW--CZG3vGy8C9R3P24Bv_VQ?usp=sharing), but the training data has to be created using the Roipoly Function that is there in the python file. 

The test data set can be downloaded from my [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16TEr7pheOu617YEZPhgI8h79I_vpS-rP?usp=sharing)

You might have to save the data and change the location accordingly.
This project will not work right out of the bag.
