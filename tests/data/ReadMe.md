This is where the testing data should be. 

The testing data can be downloaded from my [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16TEr7pheOu617YEZPhgI8h79I_vpS-rP?usp=sharing)

The pixel_classification folder consists testing data for pixel classification.
The bin_detection folder consists testing data for bin detection.
